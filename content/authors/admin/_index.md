I'm a undergrad student interested in particle phenomenology, theoretical physics and competitive programming. Currently, I'm a year away from finishing the universoty at PUCP.bjhb guy uguy g yu  u

I get started in Physics watching the famous Cosmos series conducted by Neil deGrasse Tyson while I was stil in highschool. After two years studying electronic engineering I switched into Physics to pursue that kid's goal to be a scientist and push the frontiers of knowledge, and I hope to be part of that collective effort and also contributing to the ICPC/IOI comunnity in Per√∫.
