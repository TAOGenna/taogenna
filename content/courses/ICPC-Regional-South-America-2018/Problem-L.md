Consider that for each numer $x$ we have saved all the queries which take place there(query of the form $(x,k)$). Now since we a re interested in knowing the asnwer for all numbers $\leq x$ it just don't have any sense to be worried about the values $\geq x$. With that in mind we can update on the way what is the greatest prime divisor for number/position $x$.
|10|
Once we have reached position $x$ we have to make an update because $k\geq x$.
