After some days of pure suffer I realize that Aliens trick is the ultimate stage on DP optimizations. So I would rank it as the last topic to be studied. It's better to begin with more well know techniques such as the classics optimizations on DP such as:

- Knuth Optimization
- Convex Hull Trick
- Divide & Conquer Optimization 
- Alien's Trick
